"3.4.2 Ensure /etc/hosts.allow is configured" : [FAILED]
The /etc/hosts.allow file supports access control by IP and helps ensure that only authorized systems can connect to the system.

The file "/etc/hosts.allow" does not contain "^[\s]*ALL[\s]*:"

Solution : 

Run the following command to create /etc/hosts.allow: 
# echo 'ALL: <net>/<mask>, <net>/<mask>, ...' >/etc/hosts.allow where each <net>/<mask> combination (for example, 
'192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0') represents one network block in use by your organization that requires access to this system.

"6.1.8 Ensure permissions on /etc/group- are configured" : [FAILED]
The /etc/group- file contains a backup list of all the valid groups defined in the system.

Rationale:

It is critical to ensure that the /etc/group- file is protected from unauthorized access. 
Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.

The file /etc/group- with fmode owner: root group: root mode: 0644 attr: ---------------- uid: 0 gid: 0 uneven permissions : 
FALSE  does not match the policy value owner: root group: root mask: 0177 uneven permissions : TRUE 


Remote value: 

/etc/group-

Solution : 

Run the following command to set permissions on /etc/group- :
# chown root:root /etc/group-
# chmod u-x,go-wx /etc/group-
